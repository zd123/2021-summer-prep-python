The Alanna Homes Champion Novice Hurdle is a Grade 1 National Hunt hurdle race in Ireland which is open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Punchestown over a distance of about 2 miles and 4 furlongs (4,023 metres), and during its running there are twelve hurdles to be jumped. The race is for novice hurdlers, and it is scheduled to take place each year during the Punchestown Festival in late April or early May.

Previous sponsors of the race have included Menolly Homes, Dunboyne Castle Hotel and Land Rover. Swordlestown Stud, sponsored the race from 2010 to 2012 and it was named in memory of the stud's former owner Cathal Ryan.[1] Tattersalls Ireland sponsored the race from 2013 to 2017 while Profile Systems were the 2018 sponsors. The current sponsor, Alanna Homes, began sponsoring the race in 2019.

The field usually includes horses which ran previously in the Ballymore Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham, and the last to win both races was Mikael d'Haguenet in 2009.
